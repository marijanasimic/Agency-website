Agency website is a very interesting and engaging one-page website example. What makes this site unique is that they keep all the relevant information (what the website is about, services, projects, team, pricing, and contact information) on one page. 

Sticky navigation and buttons help visitors find what they need without having to scroll the entire page.  It also uses a slider, which tells audience more about the product without visually clogging up the page.
